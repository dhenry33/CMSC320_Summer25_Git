Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps managing changes and lets you see the history of the changes. It also provides an effective way to manage collaboration with other coders. It also allows an effective way to backup your code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: It can be applied to almost any field. For example, risk analysis in finance.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging just combines the histories of the two branches by making a new merge commit. This preserves the entire history of both branches. However rebasing moves the branchs commits on top of the other branch. Rebasing creates a linear history by moving the branch onto the top of main branch.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Im most interested to learn some real world techniques used in data science. I've only ever learned the very basics so im excited to gain an understanding in more complex processes. Particularly in this class, Im very excited for the semester long project. Ive never got to do a group CS project and im looking forward to learning about collaborating with other programmers. I hope to find an interesting and fun dataset to explore for this project.
